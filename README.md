+ Description
    + Web-tool for collaborative creation hypergraphs of knowledge 
        + with 
            + tags interface
            + functions of dynamic self-optimization + the structure
            + and other biological functions,  mechanisms taken and mimic from structure of the brain

+ Tasks to be closed by the project
	+ Creating of a complex classification of the key concepts of any science or app or process or book or article or something else
        + by the object method with tag interface
        + group of functions which can improve the structure of some knowledge and compress it
    + Creation of a platform for collaborative structured knowledge editing
        + Information from which can be used for complex systems integrated with AI

### Terminology v 0.1

+ Basic
    + <span class="class_synapse">#neuron</class> is a file that contains a tree structure of words (ordinary(weak synapses) and synapses)
    + #synapse is a word with a hash tag that is found in the tree structure of a neuron. If different neurons have the same synapses, then they form connections between these neurons.
    + #connection is a fibers of different weigth that connect synapses with the same values. The fibers thicknesses are determined by row number, row depth (tabulation), components selective activation and weight index.
    + #microfeature is a part of the chain_of_fathers from 2 or more fathers (features).
    + #chain_of_fathers is parents hierarchy of the target synapse. It's contain a lot of microfeatures.

+ #neural_activity
    + #neural_activation
        Number index is characterized the significance of summarizing activations of target synapses. In many causes the index is 0 because the neuron has no target synapses.
    + #tangle of activation
        Chain activation of neurons by key synapses and addition synapses, which are strengthen or forgotten during the collect of the tangle of activations. 
        A target neuron can has no key synapses but it can activate by strengthening addition features of previous truly target neurons.
    + #mental_image is a combination of several tangles.

+ #components_selective_activation
    + #dendrites_outgrowths are dead-end superstructures over synapses that are formed with each neuron activation. 
        And they are destroyed if other neurons except the target one are activated. 
        Needed to store information about recent activations. 
        Dendrites outgrowths allow the system to dynamically adapt to the most frequent activations of recent times, increasing their significance.
    + #receptors of the synapses
        These are functional components of a synapse that affect on the activation of the neuron at the synapse.
        The distribution of receptors in synapses is different, which allows us to create another meta-graph of the distribution of dynamic-activations.
        Each synapse has its own combination of receptors with difference weight of activation.
        We can secrete neurotransmitters that will instantly turn off or turn on groups of synapses from the search.
            example receptors names: AA, BBB, ABA, AVF ... 
    + #neurotransmitters is different instanses for activation one receptor or them functional group. 
        #cluster_neurotransmission is summarizing index of the weights all receptors of the neuron. For learning tagsystem

+ Learning
    + Task: get more complete object properties when querying the graph
    + It is #neurogenesis or #synaptogenesis. 
    + The formation facultative_neuron and transfering into conservative_neurons. 
    + Changing weights of synapses.
        + #neurogenesis is formation of facultative_neuron.
        + #synaptogenesis is formation of new synapses both of type neurons. Main targets are new neurons or neurons with the most frequent activation.
