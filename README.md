+ Description
    + Web-tool for collaborative creation hypergraphs of knowledge 
        + with 
            + tags interface
            + functions of dynamic self-optimization + the structure
            + and other biological functions,  mechanisms taken and mimic from structure of the brain

+ Tasks to be closed by the project
	+ Creating of a complex classification of the key concepts of any science or app or process or book or article or something else
        + by the object method with tag interface
        + group of functions which can improve the structure of some knowledge and compress it
    + Creation of a platform for collaborative structured knowledge editing
        + Information from which can be used for complex systems integrated with AI

Terminology v 0.1

### Basic
————————
Neuron is a file that contains a tree structure of words (ordinary(weak synapses) and synapses)

Synapse is a word with a hash tag that is found in the tree structure of a neuron. If different neurons have the same synapses, then they form connections between these neurons.

Connection is a fibers of different weigth that connect synapses with the same values. The fibers thicknesses are determined by row number, row depth (tabulation), components selective activation and weight index.
————————
### Neural activity
————————
Neural activation
Number index is characterized the significance of summarizing activations of target synapses. In many causes the index is 0 because the neuron has no target synapses.

Tangle of activation
Chain activation of neurons by key synapses and addition synapses, which are strengthen or forgotten during the collect of the tangle of activations. A target neuron can has no key synapses but it can activate by strengthening addition features of previous truly target neurons.
